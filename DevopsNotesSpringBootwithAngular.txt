//// Deployment SpringBoot with Angular   Steps To follow //////
1.create a RDS and add endpoint and credentials in application.properties    and to more visibility create a instance of rds in MySQL work bench.
2.2)build a jar file of project of Backend
3.3) create a EC2 instance login  to EC2 using the Mobxtream (app).
4.4)Install Java and Maven on the Ec2
5) create a folder -> navigate to the folder (using CD command )and -> drag and drop  jar file in that
6) run the jar file using moup commad.
for FrontEnd -> 7) Copy the Public of the Ec2 instance and replace local host with the Ip address in the front end.
8) build the front end using npm run build you get  dist file when you build the project.
9) In ec2 instace install ngnix or httpd  when you install ngnix or httpd  go to the folder /var/www/html.
10)drop and drop all the dist file and foler in the html.
11) mention all the ports like backend port and front port in the ec2 ->security group ->edit in bound rules ->add group  (mention port no, select any where fron Ipv4 ) and click on add
12) copy the pubic ip of ec2 and check it in the browser.


1.create a RDS and add endpoint and credentials in application.properties    and to more visibility create a instance of rds in MySQL work bench.

A. 1 step refrence video .https://youtu.be/gCTOitR31Eg?si=RCyZ_uQ7T7elUj3m.
2.2)build a jar file of project of Backend

A. step create a  build file in backend .

3.3) create a EC2 instance login  to EC2 using the Mobxtream (app).

A. refrence video https://youtu.be/9Gxt8iklOio?si=EflDL4xh8uZMR3ch.


//4 .4)Install Java and Maven on the Ec2
A.
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
java -version
sudo apt install maven -y.
//5) create a folder -> navigate to the folder (using CD command )and -> drag and drop  jar file in that  and 6) run the jar file using moup commad.
A.
create a folder in mobaxstream mkdir foldername.
nohup java -jar your-application.jar > output.log 2>&1 &.


for FrontEnd -> 7) Copy the Public of the Ec2 instance and replace local host with the Ip address in the front end.

A.replace the local host in envirolnment file  with the Ec2 instance Public IPv4 address.


8) build the front end using npm run build you get  dist file when you build the project.
A.command npm run build. some times need to change the  production buget in chnage to  in angular.json file  "budgets": [
                {
                  "type": "initial",
                  "maximumWarning": "500kb",
                  "maximumError": "3mb"
                },
                {
                  "type": "anyComponentStyle",
                  "maximumWarning": "2kb",
                  "maximumError": "2mb"
                }
              ],
			  
			  
			  Add the ports in the security group
			  
			  
9) In ec2 instace install ngnix or httpd  when you install ngnix or httpd  go to the folder /var/www/html.
A.install the this commands in mobaxstream

1.sudo apt install httpd

if you get error like this 
home/ubuntu
ubuntu@ip-172-31-52-210:~$ sudo apt install httpd

  nginx 1.24.0-2ubuntu7
You should explicitly select one to install.

E: Package 'httpd' has no installation candidate

type this command -- sudo apt install apache2
after first command type this command -----sudo systemctl start apache2
To read all the dist file only first time type this command 
sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html

11) mention all the ports like backend port and front port and HTTP -port no 80 and SSH -port no -20 in the ec2 ->security group ->edit in bound rules ->add group  (mention port no, select any where fron Ipv4 ) and click on add
12) copy the pubic ip of ec2 and check it in the browser.



which jar is running backend command----- ps aux | grep java
To kill the previous jar----kill -9 287897
To see the jar -ls
to run the latest jar -nohup java -jar payroll-06-12-2023-SNAPSHOT.jar &
To see the error log-tail -f nohup.out
----completed---------


-----fortend  commands---
To shift backend  directory to fortend directory - cd ..,cd fortend
To delete the previous fortend  dist files command -sudo rm -rf *
need to check deleted or not -ls
need to go in /var/www/html/-cd /var/www/html/
need to remove files in /var/www/html/ -sudo rm -rf*
need to see the list -ls
agin need to come in fortend folder cd
cd he.coepd.com
cd fortend
need to drag and drop the files
after drag and drop the dist files in fotend need to copy to /var/www/html/ --sudo cp -R /var/www/html/
again need to check the copeid or not /var/www/html/ -ls
To restart the fortend ---sudo systemctl restart nginx
